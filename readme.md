  Instructions:                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                    
  1. Prepare the gelatin: In a medium bowl, whisk together the gelatin mix and boiling water until the gelatin is     
  dissolved.                                                                                                          
  2. Add cold water: Stir in the cold water.                                                                          
  3. Add cherries: Gradually fold in the drained cherries.                                                            
  4. Pour into mold: Pour the gelatin mixture into an 8-inch square baking dish or individual molds.                  
  5. Refrigerate: Refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or until firm.                                                    
  6. Unmold: To unmold, dip the baking dish briefly in hot water. Invert the jello onto a serving plate.              
                                                                                                                    
  Tips:                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                    
  • For a firmer jello, use 1 1/2 cups of cold water.                                                                 
  • To make the jello more flavorful, add a few drops of cherry extract to the gelatin mixture.                       
  • For a layered jello, alternate layers of cherry jello with vanilla or other flavors.                              
  • To make cherry jello shots, pour the gelatin mixture into individual shot glasses.                                
  • Serve the jello with whipped cream or ice cream.    |
